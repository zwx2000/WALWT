1、Program with machine language according to the following c.

int_8 a = 1;

int_8 c = a + 3;

1）Write your assembly code & machine code

LOD # 1–>STO X –> LOD X –> ADD#3 –> STO Y –> HLT

2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle

Main memory –> fetch instruction –> Decode instruction –>Registers –>Get data –>Execute the instruction –> Main memory


3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU

IR：指令寄存器，用来保存当前正在执行的一条指令 

PC：程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址 

ACC：累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果

4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

2、简答题

1）What are stored in memory?

指令和数据

2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?

可以

3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.

ADD X :00000000 10000000

前八位称命令指示，第四位为寻址模式，例子中为0，表示操作数是该地址的内容；后八位称为操作数，表示数值或地址，例子中表示内存中地址128。整个例子表示加上将内存地址128中的数据

3、解释以下词汇

1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）：

An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

2）编译（Compiler）

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. 

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. 

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
